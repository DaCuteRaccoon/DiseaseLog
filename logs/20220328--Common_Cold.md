# Day 1
I start feeling a sore throat at school around lunchtime.
- Sore Throat

# Day 2
I have a worse sore throat along with a runny nose. At one point, I was literally gushing snot, and I had to make sure it wasn't one of those darn bloody noses.

I get tested for COVID. It's negative. Yay!

I take my temperature, and it's over 100&deg;F. I have a fever.

I take some medications before going to bed. Which includes [Mentholatum].

My ears also hurt a lot. Ouch!
- Sore Throat
- Runny Nose
- Fever
- Sinus Pressure

# Day 3
I stay home from school today. I am not happy about that, because today is my second-favorite day of the 5-day week!

I got hardly any sleep, because I was feeling nauseous.

I wake up and sneeze a ton with a mild cough, then decide I can't fall asleep. So I read for about two hours. Then I eat breakfast, and create this log.
- Very Mild Sore Throat
- Lots of Sneezing
- Mild Cough
- Mild Nausea
